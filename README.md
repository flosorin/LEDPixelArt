# LEDPixelArt

A swift application to create pixel art and send them to a 32x32 RGB matrix.

This app has been designed to work with the [PixelArt32x32](https://github.com/flosorin/PixelArt32x32) Arduino sketch.

The bluetooth connexion is performed thanks to the [Bluetooth Serial helper class](https://github.com/hoiberg/swiftBluetoothSerial).
